- In the JavaScript, I used a Class. I found it to make sense and using dot notation made calling methods and defining states very easy.
- Adding the functionality of the shift key and how to open and close the keyboard were barriers for a littel while. When I finally was able to figure it out, it was all that much more gratifying.
